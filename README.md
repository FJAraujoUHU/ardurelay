# ardurelay
Relay control using the digital outputs of an Arduino, either by serial commands or using the desktop app

Open the .ino file, tweak the setup variables if needed, and flash to your Arduino using the IDE. You can send commands following the syntax included in the .ino file through serial communication, or use the .exe for an easier to use GUI. You might have to click on refresh to see your Arduino listed in the devices.
